# Lea Nguyen-Lab 1

During the initial stages of this lab, I was picking sprites based on what the theme of the game/scene may be. I tried to come up with a sprite, which ended up being a bone, that would be easily made based on the limitations of my skills right now. The current lab represents a scene of a dog inside a room with a rug and a few bones. This hopes to represent a bedroom. 

Even though I settled with the bone sprite, I was wondering if there was a simple way to make a circle shape since it didn't seem like there was an obvious function that creates circles the same way as the 'ColorRect' function.
